## HackerRank Class 2 - Find the Torsional Angle in python problem solution
In this HackerRank Class 2 - Find the Torsional Angle problem solution You are given four points A, B, C, and A, C, D in a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. You are required to print the angle between the plane made by the points A, B, C and B, C, D in degrees(not radians). Let the angle be P H I.

Cos(P H I) = (X.Y)/X||Y| where X = AB x BC and Y = BC x CD.

Here, X.Y means the dot product of X and Y, and AB x BC means the cross product of vectors AB and BC. Also, AB = B - A.
